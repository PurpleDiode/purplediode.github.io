<h1>How to Graduate from High School Early</h1>
<p>

<h2>Axiom 1: HS will not allow you to graduate early without completing their graduation requirements.</h2>
<p> The requirements are not about completing a particular mastery level. They are about having a specific <i>number</i>
of credits/semesters in specific subjects. E.g. MA graduation requirements include two years of US History, and all
high schools will also tack on at least one more year of history.  Likewise, all high schools require at least 3 years
of English classes, at least 3 years of Math, at least one semester of Visual or Performance Arts, at least 3 semesters of PE, at least 2 years of Science, etc. </p>

<h2>Thesis 1: there is no way to graduate HS early. One can only <i>leave</i> hs early.</h2>
<p>One can only take so many classes per year, limited by the HS block schedule. Even if a high school allows one to include classes taken elsewhere
 (Community Colleges or Universities) on their transcript -- which is already a rarity -- they will most often not count those classes
for graduation requirements, absent some very specific agreements ahead of time, and even then it's rare that they would allow 
something like that in more than one subject.
</p>

<p>Given all the requirements, it's pretty much physically impossible to fulfill all the HS graduation requirements in 3 years. Fighting to do so, 
would take a lot of effort, and, ultimately, there is no point to it. The only thing there is to "graduating" is being able to 
participate in the graduation ceremony. And while you can't graduate early, you can actually <i>leave</i> HS early.  That's a different matter entirely.

<h3>Lemma 1: One can get their GED Early</h3>
<p>There are clear requirements for what one can do to get a GED.  I haven't looked into them, because I haven't figured out why one would
want to get a GED. 

<h3>Lemma 2: One can just leave HS, without graduating.</h3>
<p>This is actually the only useful way of "graduating" early.  But only do that if you have a reason for doing so. 

<p>
<h2>Thesis 2: The only way graduating early makes sense is if you are doing to get into Top 10 colleges.</h2>
<p>
Otherwise, there's no reason to do it.  You may as well stay in HS and take college classes.  
Schools offer dual enrollments for some classes these days, and students can take classes at UMass and Community Colleges.  
Those classes will then give them credit.

<h2>Axiom 2:  Most private colleges don't require high school graduation.</h2>
<p>They don't care.  Top 10 private colleges are among those. Meaning that the focus should be not on fulfilling the graduation requirements, 
but on taking the classes that will admit you into those private colleges.

<p>
<h3>Lemma 3: GEDs are pointless.</h3>
<p>If your aim is a private college, they don't care about GEDs or HS diploma anyway.  If your aim is a public college, you are better off 
staying that extra year in HS and getting more college credit that the public college will then count towards graduation.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
So the way "early graduation" works is that a student convinces their school to allow them to take the highest and most difficult 
classes possible in their prospective area of interest (e.g. if applying to any STEM major, the student should take all 3 Science APs, 
and for Physics it should be AP Physics C, and not AP Physics 1; and also should take AP Calc BC), and then either applying to private 
colleges in 11th grade, or just spending a lot of time taking college classes in 12th grade.

<p>
There are many reasons for why, even with the highest classes and top colleges as aspirations, you may want to not graduate early. The reason for "why not" 
is that college admissions are incredibly competitive. Even with all these top classes, and even with all the additional experiences (like jobs, 
clubs, etc.), nothing is guaranteed.  So it may be better to stay an extra year in HS and to try to get more achievements, such as Olympiad wins, 
club officer positions, internships, outside experiences, etc. 

<p>Likewise, if going for a public college, it may be better to stay in HS and take college classes and then have those classes count for
college credit. Most public colleges will accept all classes/credits from other colleges. So that would save you a lot of tuition later, and
allow one to do a double major in college or to explore further in college. 

<h2>I read all of the above, and I'm still thinking of HS early graduation as a goal</h2>
<p>Consider exploring alternative high schools.  For example, Bard College HS allows one to get their HS diploma <b>and</b> a college diploma 
in a shortened amount of time, while also taking classes at Columbia or transferring to Columbia.  There are a handful of other 
similar programs in the US.  There is also homeschooling as an option (and getting that GED) or perhaps some other nontraditional high schools, 
including nontraditional private high schools.
